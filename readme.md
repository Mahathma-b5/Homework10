THIS IS MY ASSIGNMENT-10

Excited to Join Event Manager Company as a Software QA Analyst/Developer!
As a student pursuing software engineering and now part of the Event Manager Company, I’ve begun working on an exciting project focused on building a secure and scalable REST API. This API forms the foundation of our user management system and uses JWT-based OAuth2 authentication for enhanced security. In the future, it will grow to include functionalities like event creation and registration.
